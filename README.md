# [DbUp](https://dbup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Migration Playground

The solution contains 2 approaches for managing your DB migration.

1) For project where you are using [Entity Framework ORM](./EFMirationPlayground/README.md)
2) For projects where ORM technology is not used, or the ORM technology does not support the stable migration mechanism similar to Entity Framework Migrations.
In this case [DbUp](./DBUpMigrationPlayground/README.md) is good option.
